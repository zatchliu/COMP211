My only programming experience was AP Computer Science A, so I'm only really familiar with Java

I have lived in three different states: Virginia, Florida, and North Carolina. I play golf. I have an older brother who is doing a PhD in machine learning right now. Some of my hobbies include drawing, sewing,
and origami.
